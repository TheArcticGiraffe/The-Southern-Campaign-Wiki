### 14th of Lent, Year 621, After King Era

The party steps out into the street, and is met by Markus. He asked around about [[Leena]], and though people remember her from his description, it was a little bit ago, and she may have left town already.

He also shares that he talked to a lackey of [[Baron of Zdolnia|the Baron]] and was able to get information on a job. There is a creature living in [[Stuvica Castle|the abandoned castle]] outside of town, which is coming to the farmlands around Zdolnia and stealing livestock. The castle has been abandoned, so we are free to take anything we find in there. Markus tells us that we will each receive 12 GP upon clearing the castle of the beast.

The party all agrees that since the town is not doing well, if we find anything especially valuable or helpful towards the town, that we should give it to the town instead.

The party returns to [[Nelia Tataru|Nelia's]] house. They find her sowing up garments. Upon giving her the sacrament, she is dissapointed that there is not more, but accepts it nonetheless.

Nelia goes to answer a knock at the door. She addresses him as [[George|George]], who Aethla and Shield recognize as the man they saw in the temple earlier. He is returned from travels, and brought a small necklace with pendant for Nelia. He inquires about the boarding house, saying that he saw new faces in town, which prompts Nelia to bring him to meet us, after which she leaves the room.

George explains that he has been observing us, to know if we are up to what he has in mind. He has a job, one that requires a certain level of teamwork. 

 > "Want to make sure you were what I thought you were, a team." - George

When asked what sort of job he has in mind, he deflects. He hasn't quite decided yet if we are the group he is looking for. He is going to use our current job for the Baron as a way to see if we are up to the task. 

> "If you complete the job and work together, I suppose you shall see me again." - George
 
He reveals that he will not pay not only in GP, but he has heard the party is asking around for certain people. This is not a job for killing, that is not his MO. This is for the procurement of a relic.

He reveals that he has done research into all manner of things abotu the world. As a result of this research, he has learnt a lot about the function of magic; both types, but mostly spellcasting. Natural magic is cryptic. 

Before he leaves, the party asks for some advice for our current job. He suggests that we may wish to speak to [[the herbalist]]. Their shop is just outside of town by the southern gate, with lots of plants outside.

The party is generally uneasy about his demeanor and how cryptic and witholding he is being.

Aleks wants to check with the Baron lackey about the price that we will be paid. He has a suspicion that Markus may be taking some of the reward money off the top of the reward and keeping it for himself. 

Aleks asks a couple children about the old man. They say he comes by every once in a while, and brings gifts from his travels for Nelia. He has been to the cpital at least, while one heard he has been to [[Seer]].

Aleks gives the children some spider fangs as thanks for their information, reminding them to be careful.

The party heads to the tavern to meet with Markus. They find it not too busy, but also not too empty. A couple townsfolk are around drinking, and Markus talking to [[Nicoli|the bartender]]. Markus invites us over, and as the party does, the bartender is giving Aethla a strange look like he knows her.

As Aethla gets closer, The bartender realizes where he knows Aethla from, that he knew her father; the bartender saw him when he came through town.

Markus shares that Leena may not have darted. An ex-gate-guard may have seen her run out. The party shares that [[George]] may be able to help with information about her.

Markus is clearly pretty deep into his cups, and Aleks makes it very clear this is Markus' last ale. 

The party starts asking the bartender about the beast and the castle. The castle is [[Stuvica Castle]]. The beast leaves very little trace, only occasionally leaving some  blood. The bodies of the livestock are always taken. The bartender points out a farmer at a nearby table, who may have some information.

As for the castle, it is long abandoned; it used to hold a Lord who presided over the land. They were driven out in a sort of revolt. There are rumors that the castle is haunted; strange noises can be heard, and it gets unnaturally dark.

Orion inquires about whether [[Nicoli|the bartender]] knows anyone who has been there. The town decided together to not go there, since before the bartender was born. A few times, outsiders have come and tried to explore the castle, but they have not been heard from again.

Q: Would the Baron move in?
A: Amir? Doesn't think that he would.

Q: Are you a fan of him?
A: He does his job. Suppose he has been lighter on taxes?

The bartender shares his 

Scourge. Comes in the night, takes and makes the dogs bark.
Visited many times? twice? Taken three sheep and a pig.
When? Came a week half ago last. Was asleep, the dogs started barking. 
Ever taken a human? No, thank the gods.
Anyone been to the castle. Townsfolk are scared.
Track it? To the castle, no further.

Grabs Aethla's hand. If you manage to do this, thank you. If you go in a group, hope so.

If you ever come by my farm, ask for me and we'll eat like Kings. Viktor.

Orion: what does he do with the livestock? Not eating 

Aleks: What if they're ****GASP*** what if theyre trying, the cult, taking animals to keep them away from the townsfolk.

Why does Aleks think we should go to the herbalist. Get as much information , multiple sources, even lies can reveal things about the liars.

Nicoli, how far is the castle. Not far, couple hours walk.
Do you know a Stephen in town. Not in town, left yesterday, headed South. More towns. He was  a weird guy. Didnt pay his tab on time. Friend/family. Could find friends, not sure if they would tell you? Early to mid 20s. Did he live here? Yes. Job? Worked on the fields. Nicoli leans in, created a bit of a strange crowd within community, they see him as very helpful but with a lot of enemies.

Outside the hut, large amount of flowers, the herbalist with sheers butting and bringing inside. Lady.

Aleks.
Excuse me maam. Stops. Hello, how can I help you. ALeks takes off helmet, flashes a smile. We're going to head up to the Stuvica castle, look into the livestock dissapearances. Heard that you konw something about it. More a theory. If you go up there, and I give you the info, I aska  favour. Something small. Wish for the blood of the beast. May have heard there is plagues coming up from around the area, wish to make sure our town is safe. Don'e think the blood of the beast will do much good. Growing herbs to make sure I can treat pague, rather prevent it in my town.

Seems to know about protecting things with chemical means. Trained in natural ways from the bog. Witches in Gailia, some royalty aren't a fan, but when they do leave the bog, tend to become herbalist, provide healing and natural means of 

Have a deal? Yes

The beast, I have reason to believe it is a sort of dragon, only a baby one, mind you. Like overgrown housecats.

Have something to help. Rout around in cabinet, has a vial, the glass is fragile. The liquid inside,whatever angle,see a bunch of facets of reflection. This oil, if you manage to get it on the dragon, whatever effects it has, will only affect the dragon itself., Not like dragon of myth, no fire or lightning. High pitched sound, oil will reflect back into it, will 

Orion has looked into dragons, sounds like a sapphire dragon. Only a baby.

Gives us an empty to gather blood.

Do you know why it might have taken up residence? It's haunted. I suspect it likes to be away from people, can use it's noise to keep the undead away. 

Undead? The woman looks concerned. Undead are never a good thing. Some have popped up there.

Turn on light fixtures.

Get to be more intelligent beasts as they gain experience.

Aleks takes off bandana, putting fillling 

Kill? Has a nice place to hide while itit gewts easy meals, it's not going to go willingly.

Undead protection? Ample light, and use magic. No alchemical means. Won't work? not specificxally.

Mihaela, 

Would it be worth it to wait a night.

Could go to the castle and camp it out.

Aethla glad to have Shield.

Orion nervous abot seeing a dragon up close, not sure what to think.

Head to the temple. Kohl walks in and knocks at the entrance.

My lasy, we have a mission to visit the castle nearby. Advice for reanimated creatures, the undead. Points to shield. You walk in Phyrras light. Yes. Good, it will serve you well there. Light, sacred fire if you are able to conjure it. All i can offer is my blessing and of my goddess. The goddess Galia,

Grabs a bundle of herbs, lights it with thaumaturgy, wafts the incense over it. Mutters words in infernal. 

Shield, by the way, does Nelia usually get something different, only so much to go around.

What is the sacramanet, herbs and incense used for prayer. How to get more to go around? A little late in the season, the herbalist was going to help, I believe.

Head east, see the castle up on the hill. Aleks sighs, lifts up a patch of dirt, puts a silver, and 
"Just me own" Anik, 

Path is lined with walls, up ahead they are more intact.


See the courtyard for the castle.

Castle:

Catle is in pretty good repair. See the main building, and a guerrison.

WE go up to the door of the guerrison. Door is locked, but hear something.

Aleks attempts to crowbar it, but something grabs the crowbar and yanks it out of his hand.

Sounds very rough if it is a person.

Orion casts find Fmailiar, sees some crates stacked up, and then a hand grabs the owl.

Persons hand, wearing a leather mitt.

No windows on the guerrison

Orion holds out her hands, unfurls her wings, and jumps onto the roof with a flutter, taking a rope from Aleks.

Brick and some sort of concrete, looks well

Lets the end of the rope to the ground.

There is a lock on the door.

Not sure how old/long abandoned, but Aethla would know that lots of army buildings would require enchanted locks, but if the artificer enchanted it, that would have faded away.

Aleks gathers fire wood, and teaches Kohl how to make and start a fire.

First watch, Kohl. Hear a low groaning from within the guerrison, doesn't stop. Starting to get quite a bit colder. 

- [ ] Aethla needs to get a warmer bedroll and perhaps a tent.

Second watch, Aleks, does not stop.

- [ ] Artwork of everyone around the fire on top of the guerrison.

No movement within the castle.

Aleks hucks a burning piece of wood at the castle.

Third watch, Shield. Lies in bed groaning in harmony wiht the Guerrison.

Hear the low groaning, may be cold, there is some wildlife. Butterflies squirrels around. The butterflies starting to turn white, to blend in with the

Set out hankerchief, until the morning starts.


Approach the castle, door opens easily.

Anything on the door?
