### 14th of Lent, Year 621, After King Era

The party steps out into the street, and is met by Markus. He asked around about [[Leena]], and though people remember her from his description, it was a little bit ago, and she may have left town already.

He also shares that he talked to a lackey of the Baron and was able to get information on a job. There is a creature living in the abandoned castle outside of town, which is coming to the farmlands around Zdolnia and stealing livestock. The castle has been abandoned, so we are free to take anything we find in there.

The party all agrees that since the town is not doing well, if we find anything specifically 

Step out of the temple, into the street.

See Markus outside. He asked around about Leena, remember her description, was a little bit ago, may have darted.

Mission from the Baroin. Over that was there is acastle. Something in there that comes into town and steals livestock. Really bad when the town is already not doing great, and winter is coming.

Castle been abandoned, free to take stuff. 12G each. Town is struggling, maybe if we find some extra extra stuf, give it to the town.

Got an audience with a Baron lackey

Markus suggest we ask around about the castle.

We make our way back to Nelia's house. Currently sowing up broken garments.

Was possibly expecting more

Knock at the door: 

George, brings a small necklace with a endant. Back from travels. Asks about the boarding house. George saw the new faces in town.

Nelie brings him to meet us. Nelia steps out of the room.

George has been observing us, to know what he is getting us into. A job, that requires a certain level of teamwork. Want to make sure you were what I thought you were, a team.

What sort of job? Tell yuo what, i haven;t quite decided yet, if you are what I think you are, or have what I think you have. Current job is a trial. If you complete and work together, I suppose you shall see me again. Will pay not only GP, but I hear you are asking around for certain people

You are adventurers, Killing is not my MO, produrement of a relic

Work into research into all manner of things abotu the world.

Result of research, learnt a lot about the function of magic, both types, but mostly spellcasting. Natural magic is cryptic. Give advice for this job. May wish to speak to the herbalist, Just outside of town, outside the southern gate, lots of plants outside.

The party is generally uneasy about his.

Aleks wants to check with the Baron lackey about the price that we will be paid.

Aleks leans down
Aleks asks a child about the old man. Comes by every once in a while, brings gifts from travels for Nelia. Been to the cpital at least. Heard he has been so Seer.

Aleks gives the children some spider fangs.

Head to the tavern, not too busy, not to empty. A couple townsfolk, Markus taliking to the bartender, invites us in, has a look like he knows Aethla.

The bartender realizes where he knows Aethla from. Knows her father, saw him when he came through town.

Leena may not have darted. Ex gate guard may have seen her run out. THe old man also said he could help us.

Aleks makes it very clear this is Markus' last ale. Stuvica Castle. Know anything of the beast. Leaves very little trace. Just occasional blood. The bodies are taken. Could talk to the farmer over there, he may know something. As for the castle, long abandoned, used to hold a Lord, presided over the land, was driven out in a sort of revolt. There are rumors that the castle is haunted. Strange noises , gets unnaturally dakr.

Orion: Know anyone who has been there. Decided as a town not to go there.

Townw agreed not to go there since before the bartendr was born.

People have tried afew times, outsiders,not heard from agian.

Would the Baron move in? Amir, dont think he would. Fan? Does he do his job. Suppose he has been lighter on taxes.. Nicoli is his name

Scourge. Comes in the night, takes and makes the dogs bark.
Visited many times? twice? Taken three sheep and a pig.
When? Came a week half ago last. Was asleep, the dogs started barking. 
Ever taken a human? No, thank the gods.
Anyone been to the castle. Townsfolk are scared.
Track it? To the castle, no further.

Grabs Aethla's hand. If you manage to do this, thank you. If you go in a group, hope so.

If you ever come by my farm, ask for me and we'll eat like Kings. Viktor.

Orion: what does he do with the livestock? Not eating 

Aleks: What if they're ****GASP*** what if theyre trying, the cult, taking animals to keep them away from the townsfolk.

Why does Aleks think we should go to the herbalist. Get as much information , multiple sources, even lies can reveal things about the liars.

Nicoli, how far is the castle. Not far, couple hours walk.
Do you know a Stephen in town. Not in town, left yesterday, headed South. More towns. He was  a weird guy. Didnt pay his tab on time. Friend/family. Could find friends, not sure if they would tell you? Early to mid 20s. Did he live here? Yes. Job? Worked on the fields. Nicoli leans in, created a bit of a strange crowd within community, they see him as very helpful but with a lot of enemies.

Outside the hut, large amount of flowers, the herbalist with sheers butting and bringing inside. Lady.

Aleks.
Excuse me maam. Stops. Hello, how can I help you. ALeks takes off helmet, flashes a smile. We're going to head up to the Stuvica castle, look into the livestock dissapearances. Heard that you konw something about it. More a theory. If you go up there, and I give you the info, I aska  favour. Something small. Wish for the blood of the beast. May have heard there is plagues coming up from around the area, wish to make sure our town is safe. Don'e think the blood of the beast will do much good. Growing herbs to make sure I can treat pague, rather prevent it in my town.

Seems to know about protecting things with chemical means. Trained in natural ways from the bog. Witches in Gailia, some royalty aren't a fan, but when they do leave the bog, tend to become herbalist, provide healing and natural means of 

Have a deal? Yes

The beast, I have reason to believe it is a sort of dragon, only a baby one, mind you. Like overgrown housecats.

Have something to help. Rout around in cabinet, has a vial, the glass is fragile. The liquid inside,whatever angle,see a bunch of facets of reflection. This oil, if you manage to get it on the dragon, whatever effects it has, will only affect the dragon itself., Not like dragon of myth, no fire or lightning. High pitched sound, oil will reflect back into it, will 

Orion has looked into dragons, sounds like a sapphire dragon. Only a baby.

Gives us an empty.

Do you know why it might have taken up residence? It's haunted. I suspect it likes to be away from people, can use it's noise to keep the undead away. 

Undead? The woman looks concerned. Undead are never a good thing. Some have popped up there.

Turn on light fixtures.

Get to be more intelligent beasts as they gain experience.

Aleks takes off bandana, putting fillling 

Kill? Has a nice place to hide while itit gewts easy meals, it's not going to go willingly.

Undead protection? Ample light, and use magic. No alchemical means. Won't work? not specificxally.

Mihaela, 

Would it be worth it to wait a night.

Could go to the castle and camp it out.

Aethla glad to have Shield.

Orion nervous abot seeing a dragon up close, not sure what to think.

Head to the temple. Kohl walks in and knocks at the entrance.

My lasy, we have a mission to visit the castle nearby. Advice for reanimated creatures, the undead. Points to shield. You walk in Phyrras light. Yes. Good, it will serve you well there. Light, sacred fire if you are able to conjure it. All i can offer is my blessing and of my goddess. The goddess Galia,

Grabs a bundle of herbs, lights it with thaumaturgy, wafts the incense over it. Mutters words in infernal. 

Shield, by the way, does Nelia usually get something different, only so much to go around.

What is the sacramanet, herbs and incense used for prayer. How to get more to go around? A little late in the season, the herbalist was going to help, I believe.

Head east, see the castle up on the hill. Aleks sighs, lifts up a patch of dirt, puts a silver, and 
"Just me own" Anik, 

Path is lined with walls, up ahead they are more intact.


See the courtyard for the castle.

Castle:

![[Pasted image 20220728202240.png]]

Catle is in pretty good repair. See the main building, and a guerrison.

WE go up to the door of the guerrison. Door is locked, but hear something.

Aleks attempts to crowbar it, but something grabs the crowbar and yanks it out of his hand.

Sounds very rough if it is a person.

Orion casts find Fmailiar, sees some crates stacked up, and then a hand grabs the owl.

Persons hand, wearing a leather mitt.

No windows on the guerrison

Orion holds out her hands, unfurls her wings, and jumps onto the roof with a flutter, taking a rope from Aleks.

Brick and some sort of concrete, looks well

Lets the end of the rope to the ground.

There is a lock on the door.

Not sure how old/long abandoned, but Aethla would know that lots of army buildings would require enchanted locks, but if the artificer enchanted it, that would have faded away.

Aleks gathers fire wood, and teaches Kohl how to make and start a fire.

First watch, Kohl. Hear a low groaning from within the guerrison, doesn't stop. Starting to get quite a bit colder. 

- [ ] Aethla needs to get a warmer bedroll and perhaps a tent.

Second watch, Aleks, does not stop.

- [ ] Artwork of everyone around the fire on top of the guerrison.

No movement within the castle.

Aleks hucks a burning piece of wood at the castle.

Third watch, Shield. Lies in bed groaning in harmony wiht the Guerrison.

Hear the low groaning, may be cold, there is some wildlife. Butterflies squirrels around. The butterflies starting to turn white, to blend in with the snow.

Set out hankerchief, until the morning starts.


Approach the castle, door opens easily.

Anything on the door?

Enter the castle.

Rubble on the ground, rubble clocking double doors further down the hallway.


Hall

Second floor, used to be celieing above, can see two doors above without a path above them


Room down the hallway that is unnaturally dark. A line where it becomes grayscale.
