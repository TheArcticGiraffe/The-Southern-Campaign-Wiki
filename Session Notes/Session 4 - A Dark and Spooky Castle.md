Head forward down the long hallway

Rubble and double doors, rug going through. 
Rubble is piled above the collapsed ceiling, the floor above is 14 feet up.

![[Pasted image 20220818190904.png]]

Aethla checks out the rubble, not much of value. Sconces, bricks, nothing spectacular.

Hallway, doors along the left side, big enough for one person

![[Pasted image 20220818191316.png]]

First door, Aleks tries to peek under the door.

Orion looks under the door. Dark inside, but the angle isn't right to see much. Bricks and something woder.

Aleks puts his hand on the doorknob, clicks it open, unlatches it and backs up, kicks it open. Very small dusty room. Abandoned a while ago

Go down the hallway, goes north and south



Orion sees a grand staircase to the north.

Go south and then to the east

Behind one of the doors, unnatural darkness, Shield feels like they are being watched. First eastern hallway, norh side, second from the center. Carves an eye 

Aleks goes through all, finds silver.

Aleks pokes torch into the darkness, doesnt brighten it.

Orion can see all the way in.

Khol reaches out magically, feels something, natural magic.

Aethla: Undead are a lot rarer and a much graver threat. Studies into natural magic have shown that exploitation of the land/natural order of the area can cause imbalances in the attitudes of natural magic leading to tumultuous currents. These conditions can cause undead to start cropping up if the imbalance isn't dealt with. This job has generally fallen to disciples of Aymer and their rituals used to cleanse the area


Orion can see into the room, klooks the came as the other room..

Aleks gets a door from another room and props it up to be a sort of alarm in case soemthing comes out.

Leave the door alone

- [ ] TK Go back and check out that other room.


Go to the eastern most location, locked door.

![[Pasted image 20220818193659.png]]

Orions freezes it, opens it. 

Larger room, bed, statue of Galia with chalice, table with sealed note. mirror.

The note is not dusty, and the rest of the room it.

Shield and Kohl notice we are disturbing the dust, no disturbing of the dust.,
The seal on it has a sigil, crescent moon on the bottom pointing up, a line going up and a line crossing through that and going to the right.

![[sigil.png]]

No one recognizes the symbol.

Shield checks out the cup on Aleks' request. Finds two silver, takes it.

Orion in the dresser, clothes look like nobleman, slight dusty and motheaten.

OPen the letter with Aethla mage hand, crack the seal. A bit further away than usual.

"To my dearest Patruk,

I'm writing this on the 12th of Aymerlen, 607 AKE and our expedition had hit a bit of a roadblock (pun intended). Along the path out of the caverns near Milya a cave in had trapped us in. We took it in stride however, and searched for another way out.

We didn't find one but we found something even better. On the wall was a carving depicting a natural magic circle, along with a vial containing an odd light-blue liquid. It seems that whoever had come through this cave before had encountered similar cave in issues and devised a way to use magic to free themselves. Drawing the circle on the ground using chalk as a medium and placing the vial within the centre shape, our casters could feel a certainâ€¦ draw within the crescent shape. Channeling a spell slot into it cause the rubble at the mouth of the cave to disappear! Or at least some of it, about a 5-foot area of rubble but enough for us to squeeze past the mouth of the cave. Freedom as well as another, working magic circle! What more could I ask for?

I still have yet to determine precisely what was contained in the vial though I believe it to be some sort of ghostly essence. Perhaps I'll have to view some samples within the college when I return.

I'm heading further east towards Oltedari before heading south again, just enough time to restock supplies and assess our plans. I love you dearly and I cannot wait to see you and Aethla once again.

With love,

Osmund"

TK Investigate some of the ghostly fluid, try to find some more.
TK Make a item for the letter from her fatehr.

![[Pasted image 20220818194931.png]] 
Sigil from the letter.

Aethla still doesnt know the sigil.

Head over to the left from the door.

Who has the potion? 

Who hcan throw best. SHield is the best, should take the goop onto the creature.

![[Pasted image 20220818195548.png]]

Move up to the left side 

Kohl gets right up to the border of the darkness, goes to leave, the coldest thing you've ever felt reaches out. 9 points of damage, 1strength damage.

Whatever it was is not coming out of the darkness

Go down the narrow hallway.

![[Pasted image 20220818200051.png]]

Latrines, OPrion digs through, plants growing but not muh else.

Ballroom, all tossed around. some chairs are slightly moving around.

As we peer in, a shriek.

Aethlauses a vial to "scoop"  up the blue liquid.

Everyone is safe.

What was the creature?
	ARCANA check
	Looking at how it moved, could move the furniture (which stopped now). Similar to description of a poltegeist.

Aethla and Aleks go to the piano. Strings intact, would be very out of tune.
Aleks.


- [ ] Fix the piano
- [ ] Investigate the blue liquid.


![[Pasted image 20220818203507.png]]

Comtinue up north, see another room at the end of the hallway.

Kitchen, some ceiling bricks fallen. Tables are in disrepair, no running water, anything metal is rusted.


Aleks proceeds further north.


Another room, greenhouse of sorts, some dimly lit lights, 

Troughs of some plants, simple. Trough of almost empty water.




Aethla looks through the kitchen cabinets, petrified bread and dried spices.

Aleks tastes the vaguely like spices


Come to grand stairway, some rubble. could be cleared by 5ft of clearance.

Further ahead, Galia in a kimono

Two partitions to other chambers. Statue of Galia with her Kimono.


Statue of Lyrra and Statue of Phyrra.

Phyrra and Lyria are lovers, Night god got pissed. Made it so they can't see eachother.

Phyrra on left. Sheild takes a moment.

Lyria, long flowing robe, pale blue.
Phyrra is wearing armor


Go up the stairs, Orion draws the shape, 

The feeling of channeling a spell slot, stays.

Liquid in the vial sqirls, glows pale blue, as does the 


Path up the stair.s

Blue fluid is gone from the vial.


Go up to the second floor.
