### 12th of Lent, Year 621, [[After King Era]]

We open  in some ancient elven ruins outside the town of Dolgovat.

Start off in the spider room, with people doing their shit while they short rest.  
  
Decide to go to the locked door first.  
  
Orion opens it up using the key from the first room  
  
Find a second door, open that up using the key from the spider room.  

Aleks bet's one silver that there is another door behind the second one, fails and loses his silver.
  
Inside, find a display case, smashed in glass. Inside is a small silver ring on a blue cushion. After a brief discussion of whether we should have one outside in case the doors swing shut, Aleks takes it. 

Orion casts "Comprehend Languages" in order to read an inscription on the ring, learns that it say "Ghost Burn"

TK Ask Shashank what language the ring inscription was written in.

Aethla indicates she will cast Identify on it once she has time to ritually cast it.

Party proceeds deeper into the ruin, going down the last hallway.

Finds a room with a seperate kitchen area, originally seperated by swinging doors. Looking around, there is not much, but Aethla find a bottle of some sort of red potion that no one is able to identify.

Having completely searched the ruins, the party decides to head back to town.

Aethla identifies the ring, learning it gives the user the ability to summon and launch spectral daggers. Truly something rare and impressive. The party briefly discusses whether the ring should be returned to the gang, and decides to do it to avoid harbouring any ill will and getting on the bad side of the gang.

Return to town and (TK Talk to the gang leader. GO up to what looks like a house, door opens, go in, give item, describe, have them check it, receive gold, and leave. Kohl is charming to Verica, who seems to find him alluring in some way.)

As we are leaving, Verica mentions that someone came by looking for Aleks, wearing simple leather armor. Aleks seems unsettled by this information, and we quickly leave.

Outside, Aleks hears someone call his name, and is greeted by his friend [[Markus]]. They catch up, detailing how they seperately made it here. THe party decides to go for dinner and a drink to celebrate their earnings, and Aethla takes them to [[the academic tavern and inn near the school]].

While drinking a barrel of mead purchased by Aleks and dining on roasted chicken and vegetables, Markus details how he came from a small town called [[Zdolinia]], where he was given a place to stay with a woman named [[Nelia Tataru]] in exchange for favours. He also explains that he heard [[Leena]], a mutual friend of his and Aleks', was somewhere around [[Zdolinia]], and that there was also [[The Cult|cult activity]] happening in [[Zdolinia]]. 

On Aleks' suggestion, the party decides to stay together and travel the day's walk to [[Zdolinia]] in the hopes to find more work. 

The party splits for the night, Aethla heading back to the university, with everyone else spending the night in the inn (except Aleks, who ends up sleeping in the alley outside).

They meet up in the morning, and spend the day traveling, seeing Zdolnia come into view towards the end of the day.

Markus guides them through town, leading them to [[Nelia Tataru|Nelia's]] house. They get introduced, and are offered a place to stay in exchange for some small tasks. Aleks and Shield attempt to give some gold in exchange, but is only able to convince her to take 3 gold pieces. The party and Markus retreat to their room, sleeping on cots and mats on the floor.

In the morning, they go through the house filled with active children, and find Nelia, who asks them to go to the chapel and fetch her some (TK offerings/tithings) from the priest there. 

Markus leaves in order to reach out about [[Leena]] and other possible gigs. The rest of the party heads to the chapel in the center of town to the [[The Temple of the Gilded Edge|the Temple of the Gilded Edge]].

The party enter's during a service, and waits at the back of the chapel until it ends. Aethla leads, approaching the priest, and requesting the (TK offering), which the priest brings out and details it's instructions of use.

Shield notices [[Cult Pew Carving|a symbol carved into the back of one of the pews]]. It is the symbol associated with the cult said to be active in town, and has the name [[Stephen]] carved underneath it.

Aethla and Shield both realize that one of the [[Academic Person from Dolgovat|members of the parish]] was in the [[the academic tavern and inn near the school]] in Dolgovat two days ago, when they were celebrating their reward.
