The party arrives on the second floor of [[Stuvica Castle]], spooky castle.

Still looming is the sense of being watched, maybe not from where we're standing, and the ever loomings.

Make our was down a long windeing hallway with no doors. Aleks starts looking for trapped tiles, but finds nothing.

Door at the end of the hallway, larger than the servant quarters, accents with a silvery metal.

Aleks hears nothing behind the door.


Big bedroom, statue of Lol, god of harvest and revelry. Aleks goes through the desk

Aethla find the mirror, ALeks brings the torch, see reflection, but not as seen before. Both notice we are missing shadows.

Aleks shatters the mirror.

Attempts to look in mirror shard, 

Aethla gets the mattress moved, and manages to find a key.

Aethla puts key in the hole, unlock the box.

Opens the box, a couple of earrings, made out of brass but with preytty stones. A ring, same stone set in it, and a key, perhaps familiar to Kohl. A much more secure key for a much more secure lock, usually used by the army. A little bit of the key at the end is broken off.

Earrings and ring, perhaps a jeweler, being worn by a noble lady, but very nice looking. Some high class lady would love something like these.

Aleks thinks 5G for the earrings, 4-5GP for the ring.

No clothes in the wardrobe.

Mostly journals kept by a king, and other stuff you'd find in libraries.

Aethla grabs the journals, numbered 1-4. Aethla takes all 4. Nicew, but rural royalty.

King status, there is generally 1 king. Rather odd. Need to read the journals to get a better idea.

Go back down the hallway, large dining room, with rusterd cuttlery.

Aleks goes down the hallway alone. ASee's out of the corner of his eye, a large shadow dart across.

Aleks runs back. 

Only as permanent as the spellcaster. After the spellcaster dies, the spell begins to face, higher the spell, the shorter the lasting after death.

Get up to where Aleks was.

Can see down into the rug room of the first floor.

Broken 

Large steel door at the end of the halway, no wall there.

A Very looted storage room.

Dusty, but not the same amount of dusty as every 

A week old dust. A couple footprints by the lockbox, lizard like.

Aleks sees a wall and the foot of a bed under a small door.

Big empty room. another big empty 

Suspicious hallway that ends, tapping on the wall, no indication.

"Hearth and Chandelier Operation" on a sign, next to a very large 

Very dark inside, Aleks pokes torch in, Orion can see, the flame is not that large, able to dispell a bit of the darkness around it. Vert of cards, table, sofa. Get the sense that we are being watched.

Leave the room, continue down another hallway. Mop and bucket, latrine and sink.

About a generation and a half from what we've heard since 

Giant rug. another ballroom. A lot more relaxed, a bar with a barel, tapped, Harp with some broken strings.


Orion initiates moving the rug, find not much under, some scratches that look to be from furniture moving around, not much else.

Bar of the bar, not much else, the barrel is long evaporated. Any still sealed bottle?

Stool on the stage next to the harp.

Aethla remembered a chandelier in the dark room downstairs, an remmebered someone telling us to turn on the lights in the castle

Kohl tries lighting a torch, throws it in, and kohl enters the room.

Kohl attempts to pick up torch, and passes it to Orion.

Hearth in the room, more of a fire box. Some coals and wood in there.

Orion lights it, and the light starts to dispell the darkness within the room.

Deck of playing cards, as well as a deck of tarot cards. Playing a game. Some ratty-er chairs.

Aleks opens it, and some of the light goes through a pipe, and hear ghostly ethereal screams coming from below.

Shield flips the card, usually higher class or scholars playing wiht them.



Go down to the big dark room, statue of Anek, god of rumors, informatino, and sometimes luck.

Aleks puts his head down and start flipping a silver piece in hand.

Journals are in Galian.

Notes on the desk are in Galian. Spellcasting magic, whoever wrote this did not 

Closer to the penmanship of the fourth journal.

Kohl reads that the key has some sort of repair mechanism in it.

PUt the picecs together, try torching it, nothing.

Orion flies up to the chandelier, holds it in the fire, it repairs

- [ ] TK look into the magic on the key.


Go out to the guerrison to attempt using the key.

Turn the key, Orion hears goarning. Hear a hearty thunk as the bar drops.

Open the door. Inside is a figure, as Kohl enters, we roll for initiative.
