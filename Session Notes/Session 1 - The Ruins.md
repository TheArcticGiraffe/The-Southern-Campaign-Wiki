the starting quest is from Verica Tomic, one of the Fangs of the Jackals, a gang operating in Dolgovat. The job is fairly simple and keeps you separate from the operations of the gang. There are ruins located towards the southwest of town that have long since been looted. However, strange noises have been heard coming from one of the walls and rumours of treasure being hidden back there have started popping up. You've been tasked with going to the ruins, investigating them, and hopefully bringing back magical loot for the gang. Other people have been picked by Verica to help out but they'll meet you at the ruins at the agreed upon time.



12th of Lent in 621, start in the town of Dolgovat.

A set of adventurers, who have3 each gotten a mission today. They have accepted a quest to seek out a magical relic within a set of ancient ruins. this quest, granted by [[Verica Tomic]], slightly less than legal, but we will keep our noses clean.

Each of our characters will make their way towards the ruins.

Sheild, red-orange skinned tiefling, has a big fur hood, mauve coat, leather armor painted black. Various gear hanging off her and her waist. Quiet and keeping an eye out on the landscape around. Heavy, purposeful walk.

Getting to the ruins, the outside is rather small, against a rocky cliff. Two pillars and a hole in the wall, leading to a room. Waiting outside under an outcropping.

Aethla

Khol shows up, coming across the tundra. Essetially sticks coming out of his head. Pale, but cheeks are flushed. Pink hair that comes to green. Clothes that look pretty warm, but also very expensive, city clothes. Glaive strapped to his back that looks quite decorative. A little unsure of what he's supposed to be doing. Looking around. Branches have little buds and small leaves, just starting to grow. Spots to the two people, a little out of breath.

Owlin, mature age, white feathers with brown around edge, long brown cloak. Bag with lots of papers and scraps. Necklace made from some sort of crystal, same color as eyes, a brownish green hazel. Enters the ruins, looking for people. Very small steps.

Look inside the room, very thouroughly looted, as most ruins we come across are. A very faint scratchign sound, but deep within.

Coming over the tundra, see the hiking backpack strapped to this relatively short human, stands about 5ft, wearing winter gear that's been torn, ripped, haphazardly sown together, thrown together, fixed best as possible. Beat up scabard, scratched and scuffed leather. Only other piece of metal is a small helmet with a gouge missing out of it.

Aleksandar

Ruins have been explored, but not much found. The ruins have been long ransacked, and everything except the rug  has been looted or destroyed.

Altar is similar to others, used to have a statue, animal or deity. Statue has seen better days

![[Pasted image 20220707183038.png]]

Sounds is coming from the eastern wall.

Aleks drops his backpack and is getting his crowbar.

Writing on the eastern wall, Aethla takes a look at it. A lot of the words have been translated in other works. Aftwer a couple minutes. (embrace with me to show our trust)

Aleks starts wedging aned tapping the mortar 

Can't determine 

Khol lights the brazier.

Aleks can begin to chip away at the bricks.

Gets a brick flush with the wall, after which the crowbar stops damaging the wall.

Roll up the rug, roll it aside

Try putting the statue pieces up and lieing with it.

Cross shape of pieces flush with the wall. The shape of a person in the wall.

Kohl attempts to lie backwards against it, but then switches around, and then after a hum, the wall becomes translucent.

All begin to step through, see cobwebs, area not been touch by feet in a long time. Tiles have some wear, but not overly worn. Not by anything metal. 

Shield attempts to listen for the scratching. Hear scratching coming from the east, not sure how to describe it, slightly dripping sound coming from the south.

Kohl, Aethla, and Aleks go south.

Fairly ampty room, still dripping noise, but no sign of it, not much, 

As Aleks goes to

Kohl and Aleks begin cleaning themselves off, 

Room has been slightly looted. Tables broken by the slime, the key, not much else.

Aleks looks at the key. The key is very roughly made. The ancient elves didn't have much in the way of metal making, used ironwood, have to roast it and shape it as you roast it.


![[Pasted image 20220707193310.png]]



Move along to the east, see a large room with another alter, and a stone statue of a fox with slight damage to it's bag. Another stone door leading to the east.

Under the rug, coins made out of wood. Kohl takes 3, Aleks 

Aethla takes a couple of the wooden coins.
Decide to leave the locked door until after, Orion freezes some water in the lock, the lock looks quite rusted.

Aleks throws the key to Orion.

Begin heading south, and then go east. Cobwebs are thick here, require swording and then burning.

Aleks gives Shield a piton to 

Weapon racks, and a natural magic circle, made of dried blood, although it has been removed and disrupted.

Aethla takes a sketch of what remains of the magical circle.

Stone dust up ahead, very heavy and thick.

Up ahead, we find a locker room.

Benches, weapon racks with a few weapons. Made of the same wood, and a couple of weapons: halberd, longsword, two daggers. There is also another alter with a statue of a bear. Takes another sketch

![[Pasted image 20220707194839.png]]

Check out the alter. Nothing under the rug, statue of a lioness, broken ironwood blades at it's feet.

![[Pasted image 20220707195858.png]]

Aleks doesn't find much, the blades were broken through use.

Shield doesn't recognize the symbols, heard legends about it, this looks to be moderately complex.

Go backwards, and find another statue of a cat.

![[Pasted image 20220707201220.png]]

Throuhg a narrow hallway, find another statue of a cat. On the far alter are a couple of gems. Only two. about 15GP each

Aethal looks around the cat statues. Not much else. Very few cobwebs in the far room vs the close room.



We continue south, see another circle, slighlty active, light blue light filtering up, with a spider, which is flickering and appearing slightly off from where it was.

As it sees the light and Aleks, it begins to chitter and make the scratching noise.

Spider room: 

![[Pasted image 20220707205417.png]]


Find some bones, skeletons. There is a stone tablet and a key webbed into the mouth of one of the skulls.

The magic circle is no longer glowing, once the spider stepped out of it.

What is Kohl. I can't exactly tell you, I didn't grow up with my birth family. As far as I know, we are called Eladrin.

Aethla takes a look at the elven tablet, it is a poem of some sort, or description.

"This place is not a place of honor... no highly esteemed deed is commemorated here... nothing valued is here. What is here was dangerous and repulsive to us. This message is a warning about danger.
