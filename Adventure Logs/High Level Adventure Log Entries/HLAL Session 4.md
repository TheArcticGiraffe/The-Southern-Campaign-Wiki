### 15th of Lent, Year 621, After King Era
- Head down the main hallway with the rug.
	- See that we could climb up to the second story, but it is very high up, so we decide to find a staircase instead.
	- Investigate what we determine to be servant's quarters.
		- Shield goes wild, kicking open doors. Finds one of the servant's quarters to be unnaturally dark. Orion can see in and that nothing looks amiss, but there is an eerie feeling of being watched. Party decides to leave it and move on. Aleks' torch does nothing to brighten the room.
	- Go to the eastern door by the servants quarters, Orion breaks the lock.
		- Dusty larger room inside, with a sealed scroll on the table.
		- Opening the scroll, it is a letter from Osmund to Patruk, detailing some of his expedition, as well as a depiction of a natural magic circle that was used.
	- Leave the room, head to the western branch off the main foyer
		- Kohl is investigating the unatural darkness in another room, and as he gets away from the edge of it, something reaches out and attacks him, sapping his strength. Shield provides some help in recovering.
	- Latrines in a hallway to the east, nothing of interest
	- See a ballroom with furniture scattered, a shriek erupts as we peer in.
		- After a short scuffle, we manage to defeat the invisible creature, which we believe to be a poltergiest.
		- Leaves behind some blue liquid, which Aethla scoops into a vial.
	- Continue north to a kitchen. Abandoned, lots rusted away.
	- Beyond that is a greenhouse of sorts, with some dimly glowing magical lights.
		- Also abandoned.
	- Continuing down the eastern passageways, find a grand staircase blocked by rubble. Continue past into a chapel, find a statue of Galia, and a statue of Liriya and Phyrra blocked by a partition.
- Return to the grand staircase, Orion and Aethla work together to activate the natural magic circle as described by Aethla's father to clear out the rubble on the staircase and access the top floor of the castle.
- The party arrives on the landing of the second floor of the castle.
