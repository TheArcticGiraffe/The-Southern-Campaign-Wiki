### Mechanical Abilities

This ring has 3 charges and regains all charges at each dawn.

While attuned to this ring and on your turn, you may spend a charge to summon 3 spectral daggers into the hand this ring is on, provided it is free, as a bonus action. As part of the same action used to summon them, you may throw up to all of the daggers at creatures within 60 feet of you that you can see.Â  Each targeted creature must succeed a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw for each dagger thrown at it. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d4 force damage, taking half the damage on a successful save. At the end of the turn you used this effect, all creatures that failed their saving throws take radiant damage equal to the number of creatures targeted by this effect. All summoned daggers then disappear, leaving no trace.

You may spend a spell slot of level 1 or higher as part of the summoning to amplify the effects of the ring. For each spell slot level, you summon an additional dagger, the saving throw DC increases by 1, and the radiant damage increases by 1 to each affected creature.
