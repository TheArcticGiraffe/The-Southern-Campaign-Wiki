A letter from [[Osmund Novik|Osmund]] to [[Patruk]], dated the 12th of Aymerlen, 607 AKE 

> To my dearest Patruk,
> 
>I'm writing this on the 12th of Aymerlen, 607 AKE and our expedition had hit a bit of a roadblock (pun intended). Along the path out of the caverns near [[Milya]] a cave in had trapped us in. We took it in stride however, and searched for another way out.
>
We didn't find one but we found something even better. On the wall was a carving depicting [[Circle of Remove Rubble|a natural magic circle]], along with a vial containing an odd [[Ghostly Essence|light-blue liquid]]. It seems that whoever had come through this cave before had encountered similar cave in issues and devised a way to use magic to free themselves. Drawing the circle on the ground using chalk as a medium and placing the vial within the centre shape, our casters could feel a certainâ€¦ draw within the crescent shape. Channeling a spell slot into it cause the rubble at the mouth of the cave to disappear! Or at least some of it, about a 5-foot area of rubble but enough for us to squeeze past the mouth of the cave. Freedom as well as another, working magic circle! What more could I ask for?
>
I still have yet to determine precisely what was contained in the vial though I believe it to be some sort of ghostly essence. Perhaps I'll have to view some samples within the college when I return.
>
I'm heading further east towards [[Oltedari]] before heading south again, just enough time to restock supplies and assess our plans. I love you dearly and I cannot wait to see you and Aethla once again.
>
With love,
>
Osmund

The letter also contained a drawing of the magic circle as described within the letter.

The letter was sealed with [[Osmund's Sigil|a wax seal marked with a sigil that was not recognized by anyone in the party]].
