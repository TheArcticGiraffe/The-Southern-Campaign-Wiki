Some creature living in the dark of [[Stuvica Castle]]. Cannot leave the unnatural darkness. Is able to do damage and sap the strength of those it attacks.

Possibly related to [[Watchful Prescence|the feeling of being watched]] when in eyesight of the areas of unnatural darkness.

So far encountered in the large room in the same hallway as the ballroom.
