	- Used to house [[The Lord of Stuvica Castle|a Lord]] who presided over the land. They were driven out in a sort of revolt. 
	- There are rumors that the castle is haunted.
		- Strange noises can be heard
		- Get's unnaturally dark.
	- The town decided not to go there, since before Nicoli was born.

### Floor 1

#### Lobby

#### Rug Hallway
Leads to a pile of rubble having collapsed from the floor above. The rug leads north under the rubble to a set of double doors into a room we have not yet seen. Nothing is found in the rubble. Floor of next floor up can be seen about 14ft up.

#### Small Bedrooms
Simple bedrooms, containing a simple bed, side table, and dresser. 

The first bedroom on the left of the hallway coming directly off the lobby is filled with unnatural darkness. When the door is opened, a feeling of being watched can be felt by anyone within eyesight. The darkness does not become brightened by sticking a torch within it.

#### Main Bedroom
Larger room, bed, statue of Galia holding a chalice, table with chair, mirror, dresser. The dresser contains cloths that look like those of a noble, slightly dusty and moth-eaten.

#### Big Dark Room
Can't see within in, darkness similar to in the one small bedroom. [[Kohl]] got attacked by [[Creature In the Darksomething]] when moving from the edge of the darkness, which drained his strength.

#### Latrines
Not much going on, some plants growing in the abandoned pots.


#### Ballroom
Chairs and tables all tossed around and broken. Was initially inhabited by [[Poltergeist|a poltergeist]].
Has a small stage with a piano, who's strings are currently cut.

#### Kitchen
Some ceiling bricks fallen in. A couple tables and a few set of cupboard and cook surfaces, along with sinks. Tables are in disrepair, no running water, anything metal is rusted. Found petrified bread and spices in the cupboards

#### Greenhouse
Contains some dimly lit lights, and some troughs of plants, very simple looking. Trough is almost out of water.


#### Chapel
The room is split into a larger room in the center, with two makeshift rooms to the left and right, seperated by a partition
Contains three statues. The central room has a statue of [[Galia]] in a kimono.
In the left hand room, there is a statue of [[Phyrra]]. On the right there is a statue of [[Liriya]].


#### Grand Staircase
The main staircase for accessing the second floor of the castle. Currently there is a large amount of rubble blocking a large amount of the staircase. Enough space to move past the rubble has been cleared using [[Circle of Remove Rubble|a natural magic circle]].
